# platformer2D (Slime Climb)

A project for Fundamentals of Game Development course.

Platformer2D was a test project that accidentally expanded to the whole game.
Was not sure if changing the project name would affect anything so I lef it alone.

gitignore file was copied from 
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore 
Hopefully it included everything important.
